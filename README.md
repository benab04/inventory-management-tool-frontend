# Warehouse Management System (WMS) - Drag & Drop Interface

This project is a simple Warehouse Management System (WMS) built using **Create React App (CRA)**. It allows users to manage items across different warehouses (locations) with a drag-and-drop interface. Items can be moved between warehouses, and the changes will be reflected both on the UI and in the backend database.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Move items from one warehouse (location) to another using a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The system updates the database when an item is moved to another warehouse.
- **Expandable Tree View**: Warehouses and their sub-warehouses are displayed in a hierarchical, expandable tree structure.
- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Data about items and locations is fetched from the backend API upon component load.

## Credentials

To access the system, use the following login credentials:

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password123`
